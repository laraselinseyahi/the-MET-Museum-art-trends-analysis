Thus, public interest as measured by Wikipedia page views doesn't perfectly align with object counts.\n",

        "\n",
        "The analysis reveals that while some departments hold more artifacts, public interest can diverges from sheer object count, suggesting that other factors could be influencing interest towards art, beyond the representation of different departments in The Met. Departments sharing mediums could potentially highlight historical or stylistic connections between different cultural collections. Additionally, notable artists and object types within departments offer insights into key figures and themes on art through the ages. This understanding could inform future curation, educational programs, and strategies for increasing engagement with underrepresented collections.\n",

        "\n",
        "A limitation is that the Wikipedia search data reflects only online interest, which may not reflect public's general interest in the arts or with museum visits. Additionally, the analysis relies on the metadata in the Met dataset, which varies in terms of consistency across departments, potentially impacting comparisons.  \n",

        "Future explorations could include a deeper analysis of public interest through analysing social media data for museum social media accounts or museum visitor statistics. This could provide a more holistic understanding of what drives engagement with different art departments. Furthermore, this analysis could be done through long time periods comparing interest in different time points, which can reveal how specific events in time influence interest in the arts. I would like to do more statistical analysis to reveal insights on specific artists, cultural periods, or mediums within departments.\n",
